As per our guess due to some problem in packet copying the packet 
receiving in guest is not working properly. This change log has the
below goals:
    1.Debug the error, firstly in packet receive path
    2.Properly commenting and understanding the operations done on skb
    3.Fully understand the manipulation done on memory location of skb

Result: Successful. 
Root cause: 
Calling "skb->protocol = eth_type_trans(skb, skb->dev);" this in both
the receive and send path was stripping the MAC header .. so the 
complement of this call is     skb_push(skb,ETH_HLEN); we add this
so the error debugged.In send path the checksum calculation is still 
messing up. So In the hw device I off the rx,tx etc off. Then it was 
working fine. Robustness check done. Iperf server and client was run
for 1 hour and it was perfect.

Useful command:
ethtool -K eth5 rx off
ethtool -k eth5
iperf -c 10.129.75.139 -t 3600 -P 10
